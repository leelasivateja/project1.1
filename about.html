        <p>what is html</p>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It provides the basic structure and layout of a webpage, which can be styled with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and made interactive with JavaScript.

HTML uses tags or elements to define content types like headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists, tables, and more. Each tag usually has an opening <tag> and a closing </tag>, and the content goes between them. For example, <p>This is a paragraph.</p>.

        <summary>Why we use HTML</summary>
        <p>HTML is used to create the structure and content of web pages. It allows developers to define headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other elements that make up a webpage. Without HTML, web pages would just be plain text without any formatting or structure.</p>
        <p>HTML is essential for building websites because it provides the basic building blocks for web content. It enables browsers to interpret and display the content correctly, ensuring a consistent experience for users across different devices and platforms.</p>
        <p>In summary, we use HTML because it is the foundation of web development, allowing us to create structured, accessible, and visually appealing web pages.</p>
